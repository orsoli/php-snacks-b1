### Snack 4A: 
**Print on the page, without any particular styling, the name of each class and below each one, the details of every student present in the respective class.**

### Snack 4B: 
**Filter our array and display, still divided by class, only the students with a sufficient average grade.**

### Snack 4C: 
**Comment out the filter from point 4B (leave it in the code so we can still see it) and add a minimum amount of styling as you wish. Then, insert a form where the user can input a maximum average grade, and filter based on it only students with an average grade lower than the entered grade.**
